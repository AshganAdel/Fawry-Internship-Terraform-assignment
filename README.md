# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware or interactive configuration tools.

*Terraform* is a popular open-source IaC tool that enables developers to define and provision infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable manner.
